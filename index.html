Thoughts of you surround me.
You’re the beating of my heart.
The love you give defines me.
My life is no longer dark.
You give your hand so sweetly.
I am lost if you’re away.
You have me so completely.
I cherish you night and day.
Without your breath, I cannot live.
Never a day you’ll feel alone,
And I’ll yell it oh so loud.
L is for ‘laughter’ we had along the way.
O is for ‘optimism’ you gave me every day.
V is for ‘value’ of being my best friend.
E is for ‘eternity,’ a love that has no end.
I love you with all my heart.

<p><FONT STYLE="font-family:Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Jagriti you are special to me. You hold a place in my heart that none can or ever held. Seeing you smile makes me smile, seeing you cry my eyes too get wet but never let you notice it. You are the reason of my happiness; you are the special one to me and I promise to give you all happiness that you deserve. I won’t let a single drop tear roll out of your eye. I wish if I could call you mine. I still remember the day we started talking. There is no reason to love you because if there had been a reason to love you there must also be a reason to hate you and for me, I can’t even imagine to hate you. If someone asks me what is love, seeing you I will answer with a smile that love is Jagriti. Your eyes are pretty enough, so deep that express each and every emotion you have hidden inside.  I would travel miles just to see you smile and meet you. I still remember how you hold my hand for the first time. I can’t control two things my smile when I see you, and tears when I miss you. My undecide attention for you allows me to ignore the whole world. You mean everything to me; you are my world where I want to get lost forever. I don’t know what you want from me but I will always keep you happy. I would never regret a second if I had locked down with you. Once I am Yours, I will stay loyal and committed to You and only You. Neither you were nor will be an option for me you will always be my priority. With you I’m happy. When I’m with you, I act different, in a good way. I smile mor and laugh more on seeing and being with you. With you I can drop a fake smile, and have a real one. I can’t even think of seeing you cry and try to hurt you by my words and actions.You’re easy to talk to, and you listen to me. I never want to stop making memories with you. Each and every moment that I had spent with you hold a close place in my heart that can be never get out of my mind or heart. Everything is better and lovely when you are with me. Talking to you, laughing with you, being with you changes my whole mood. You should know that I am and will be entirely yours. In a world full of treasure, I’d still look for you. I am horribly jealous of anyone seeing you happy because that’s all I want. I am incomplete without you. Without your presence in my life, life seems meaningless. Nothing feels nicer than my hands in yours. Whenever I look at your picture, I wish I could see you, touch you, feel you in real. I love you and want to have you with me forever.</FONT></p>
